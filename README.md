Cheese blocks spawn randomly, 65% chance stun you, 30% if you have the defense of noseplugs of lavender
Smart rats: Move closer to you, 85% chance attack without a shield and 15% if using a shield
Dumb rats: attack if within 3 squares, constant 30% chance attack with or without shield
Player: 5 hit points against rats
Defenses: noseplugs of lavender, trash can shields
attacks: ziplocks against the cheese, exploding kitties against the rats.
To play: compile C++ code on a terminal and run main.cpp. Requires cygwin.
